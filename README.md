# AutoModelGen
My name is Felipe, i'm a Computer enginering student. I want to do a solution on windows for everyone who is looking for doing some AI voices with SVC.
Did you notice that wherever you look for tutorials do you always find some strange things that you don't know, with hard processed and nothing is clear?, cause i have.
I want to do a efficient, fast and easy way to everyone who is looking for do anything with AI voices (SVC). Can just do it, with no need of hard investigating, install random things, or do kind of "Anonymous"
things, just download the client and have access to everything in just one place.
They would just need to give de Audio sample and the acapella or voice to merge. Everything else will be done automatically by the program (Cutting samples, making/training model, merge the audios, etc).
i'm kind of new in this type of coding, but if you are new or advanced. You're always welcome to contribbute this repository or suggest something, thanks!.
