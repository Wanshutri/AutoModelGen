My name is Felipe, and I'm a computer engineering student. I want to create a Windows solution for anyone looking to work with AI voices using SVC.

Have you ever noticed that no matter where you look for tutorials, you always come across unfamiliar and complex processes that lack clarity? I certainly have.

I aim to provide an efficient, fast, and user-friendly solution for anyone interested in working with AI voices (SVC). They should be able to do it without the need for extensive research, installing random software, or engaging in 'anonymous' activities. Just download the client and have access to everything in one place.

Users would only need to provide the audio sample and the acapella or voice to merge. Everything else will be handled automatically by the program, including cutting samples, creating/training models, merging the audio, and more.

I'm relatively new to this type of coding, but whether you're a beginner or an advanced user, you're always welcome to contribute to this repository or suggest improvements. Thank you!
